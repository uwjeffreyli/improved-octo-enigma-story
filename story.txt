Once upon a time there was a person named Jeffrey Li. He was sitting at home
using linux and doing his programming assignment. 
Jeffrey was a good student that always got his assignments done on time. 
This particular assignment was with his X-team. For this assignment the 
X-team had to use linux and git hub to write some stories. This is one of 
those stories. Jeffery wrote the first paragraph and his teammate Joseph
wrote the second paragraph.
