Once upon a time there was a person named Jeffrey Li. He was sitting at home
using linux and doing his programming assignment. 
Jeffrey was a good student that always got his assignments done on time. 
This particular assignment was with his X-team. For this assignment the 
X-team had to use linux and git hub to write some stories. This is one of 
those stories. Jeffery wrote the first paragraph and his teammate Joseph
wrote the second paragraph. 
After Joseph wrote the second paragraph, it was Jacob who wrote the third.
He too thought that both Jeffrey and Joseph were good students and that this
assignment was pretty interesting. Jacob really enjoyed learning more about 
the commands and continuing writing this awesome story.
Finally Luke wrote the fourth paragraph after Joseph wrote his. Luke thought
they were all very very good students and that this story was turning out to
be quite the novel.
